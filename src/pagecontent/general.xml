    This section defines the "core" profiles and concepts that would be expected to be present in most genetic reports, regardless of type and how those profiles relate to each other.  Concepts covered include the genomics report itself and the high-level categories of observations and other elements that make up the report, such as patient, specimen, variants, haplotypes, genotypes, etc.

  <h2>Diagnostic Report</h2>
  <p>
    The <a href="diagnosticreport.html">diagnostic report</a> is the focus of all genetic reporting.  It groups together all "relevant" information found as part of the genetic analysis.  (Rules for relevancy will be dependent the type of testing ordered, the indicated reason for testing and the policies of the lab.)  The information found is expressed as FHIR <a href="{{site.data.fhir.path}}/observation.html">Observations</a>.  These observations fall into one of four categories:
  </p>

  <p>
    <b>Figure 1: Genetic Report Overview</b>
  </p>
  <table>
    <tbody>
      <tr>
        <th>Genetic Interpretations</th>
        <td>These are high-level assessments of the result of the genetic testing, generally expressed based on the question asked in the initiating diagnostic service request.  For example, "Were any deletions or duplications found?"</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <th>Genetic Impacts</th>
        <td>These represent [[phenotypic assertions]] about the patient based on the genetic test results.  For example, "Patient may have increased susceptibility to heart attacks"</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <th>Genetic Assertions</th>
        <td>These are observations about the specimen's genetic characteristics.  For example, a chromosomal abnormality, genotype, haplotype or variant that was detected.</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <th>Specimen Characteristics</th>
        <td>These are observations that provide descriptive information about one of the specimens under test but are not specific to the genetic characteristics of the specimen.  For example, the 'source' of the specimen (fetus, germline tissue, tumor, etc.)</td>
      </tr>
    </tbody>
  </table>
  <p>
    In addition to the observations included in the report, some reports might also recommend specific actions be taken, such as genetic counseling, re-testing, adjusting drug dosages, etc. - driven by the results found.  These are covered by the <b>Recommended Action</b> category and are expressed using FHIR's <a href="{{site.data.fhir.path}}/task.html">Task</a> resource.
  </p>
  <p>
    As shown in the diagram above, all of the observations may hang directly off of the <a href="diagnosticreport.html">diagnostic report</a>  However, they can also be part of a <a href="obs-gen-panel.html">panel</a>.  In this version of the specification, no guidance is provided on when or if panels should be used.  This is left up to the discretion of the reporting lab.  Observations might be organized on the basis of subject, specimen, chromosome, gene, condition/disease, medication or other appropriate measure.  The recursive "hasMember" relationship on panel supports a nested tree-structure of panels if appropriate, though more than two levels of panels is likely excessive.
  </p>
  <a name="lookedfor"> </a>
  <blockquote class="stu-note">
    <p>One area yet to be resolved is how to best capture "what was looked for" - i.e. the genes/diseases/medications/etc. that were evaluated as part of testing.  Because FHIR resources are intended to be stand-alone, any of this information that is relevant to a particular Observation needs to be conveyed as part of that Observation.  The work group is still considering how best to reflect this information in the model.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>
    Any organization of observations into panels or sub-panels is purely for navigation and presentation purposes.  It carries no additional "meaning".  Each observation can be interpreted on its own without knowing the associated panel or sub-panel.  The organization of observations in panels does not assert any relationship between observations.
  </p>
  <p>
    However, it <b>is</b> possible for relationships to exist between different types of relationships.  Such relationships are asserted directly on one of the affected observations.  Some of these relationship types are defined on the basis of the high-level observation category the observation belongs to.  Others will be defined for narrower categories or explicit observation types.  The high-level category relationships are shown in the following diagram:
  </p>
  <img src="1-general-fig2-category-relationships.png" alt="Class diagram showing the high-level categories of the component parts in a genetic diagnostic report"/>
  <p>
    <b>Figure 2: Genetic Report Category Relationships</b>
  </p>
  <p>
    The relationships between categories are as follows:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li><i>Genetic Interpretations</i> can be "derived from" <i>Genetic Assertions</i>.  For example, an interpretation asserting that "deletions or duplications were found" might be supported by observations of variants that contain deletions and/or duplications.</li>
    <li><i>Genetic Impacts</i> MUST be "derived from" <i>Genetic Assertions</i>.  For example, in a genetic report, it's not acceptable to assert "patient is an increased metabolizer of drug X" without also indicating the variant, haplotype or genotype found that supports that assertion.</li>
    <li>Every <i>Recommended Action</i> will have at least one reason relationship to either a <i>Genetic Interpretation</i> or <i>Genetic Assertion</i>.  For example: a recommendation to increase the dosage of a medication might be tied to a genetic interpretation indicating that the patient is an increased metabolizer of that medication; an assertion that re-testing should be performed on a variant that was detected but had low quality metrics for certainty. </li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    This diagram also shows a specific example of a <i>Recommended Action</i> - the <a href="task-rec-followup.html">Recommended Followup</a> which includes suggestions for confirmatory testing, additional testing and/or genetic counselling.

  <h2>DiagnosticReport-genetics Profile</h2>
  <p>
    This DiagnosticReport-genetics is built on top of DiagnosticReport. The new profile is used to describe a genetics test report. The result element in DiagnosticReport will refer to the Observation resource that can lead to a bundle of genetic observations. The element of code, effective[x], issued, performer, request, specimen are be used to describe the details of the genetic test. Extensions about AssessedCondition and FamilyMemberHistory are added. Overall, this profile extends the DiagnosticReport resource to enable reporting of structured genetic test results. In addition, it denotes condition context for genetic testing, which may influence reported variants and interpretations for large genomic testing panels.
  </p>
  <p>Following is the list of the extension in the DiagnosticReport Profile</p>
  <ul>
    <li>DiagnosticReport-geneticsAssessedCondition</li>
    <li>DiagnosticReport-geneticsFamilyMemberHistory</li>
    <li>DiagnosticReport-geneticsAnalysis</li>

  <h2>HLA genotyping results profile</h2>
  <p>
    Human leukocyte antigen (HLA) genotyping is fundamental for research and clinical practice in immunogenetics and histocompatibility. Pointers to external locations refer to registered methods, raw NGS reads, and reference standards can be conveyed in this profile. Information about allele assignment including ambiguous results and the allele database used for assignments is stored in extensions.
  </p>

  <p>
    The structure of the HLA typing report in this profile attempts to follow the principles outlined in the Minimum Information for ReportIng Next-generation sequence Genotyping (MIRING). These principles were identified through a series of meetings with international group of stakeholders in the application of Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) technology for genotyping the HLA and KIR loci as well as other immune-related loci (http://igdawg.org/ngs.html). MIRING describes eight principles, described in detail in <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26319908">Human Immunology. 2015 Dec; 76(12):954-962</a> . These include detailed metadata about:
  </p>
  <ol>
    <li>MIRING Annotation</li>
    <li>Reference Context</li>
    <li>Full Genotype</li>
    <li>Consensus Sequence</li>
    <li>Novel Polymorphisms</li>
    <li>Platform Documentation</li>
    <li>Read Processing Documentation</li>
    <li>Primary Data</li>
  </ol>
  <p>
    These principles were implemented in a technical specification by extending an existing XML based format for exchanging histocompatibility and immunogenetic genotyping data called Histoimmunogenetics Markup Language (HML) to include results from NGS methodologies (https://bioinformatics.bethematchclinical.org/hla-resources/hml/). The resulting schema may be found in https://schemas.nmdp.org/. The National Marrow Donor Program (NMDP)/Be The Match uses this format for reporting HLA genotyping from potential donors and for patients needing stem cell transplants.
  </p>
  <p>
    Both MIRING and HML were used to inform mapping data elements to FHIR resources such as Patient, Specimen, Sequence, Observation-Genetic Profile, and DiagnosticReport where possible. Several additional data elements were needed specifically for this use case, resulting in the development of a specific profile for reporting HLA genotyping results (Diagnostic Report Profile for HLA Genotyping Results).

  <h2>General Relationships</h2>
  <p>
    To allow searching and appropriate navigation, the diagnostic report, observations and tasks cannot stand on their own.  They need to be related to the associated patient and/or specimen, the order that initiated the testing, the lab that performed the testing, etc.  FHIR design principles dictate that these associations be present on <i>every</i> resource instance.  That's because each resource could be accessed on its own as part of a query response, embedded in a document or message, passed to a decision support engine, etc.  However, this is still relatively lightweight because the information is included by reference only.
  </p>
  <p>
    The following diagram shows the relationships between the diagnostic report, observations and other elements used in the profile.  Note that there is no expectation that all relationships will point to the same instances.  In some cases, a genetic report may involve multiple patients or multiple specimens.
  </p>
  <img src="1-general-fig3-other-relationships.png" alt="Class diagram showing the interrelationships between DiagnosticReport, Observation, Task, Patient, Specimen, etc."/>
  <p>
    A few key points to take from this diagram:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li><a href="servicerequest.html">Orders for genetic testing</a> and the <a href="diagnosticreport.html">reports resulting from them</a> can be associated to patients, to <a href="specimen.html">specimens</a> or both.</li>
    <li>Most of the time, patient-centric orders and reports will point to only a single Patient.  However, an extension is available to identify additional patients in the case of genetic reports involving multiple individuals (e.g. paternity testing).</li>
    <li>Specimens may be linked to a specific subject, but they can also be stand-alone.  For example, genetic testing of a sample swabbed from a counter-top.</li>
    <li>Family member history and tasks are always associated with a patient, not a specimen.</li>
    <li>All genetic observations are derived from a <a href="obs-base.html">common abstract profile</a> that asserts they should have a category, effective date, issued date and status.</li>
    <li>The effective date is the date the genetic specimen was collected and the issued date is when the observation was performed.</li>
    <li>Of the different types of observations, Genetic Findings all have exactly one specimen.  The remainder might be associated with a specimen, but might not.</li>
  </ul>

  <a name="findings"> </a>
  <h2>Genetic Findings</h2>
  <p>The primary focus of genetic testing is making Genetic Findings.  These are the fine and coarse-grained descriptions of a specimen's genetic characteristics.  It is this information that leads to the actionable <i>Genetic Impacts</i> and the <i>Overall Interpretations</i> for the study.
  </p>
  <img src="1-general-fig4-genetic-findings.png" alt="Class diagram showing relationship of Descriptive and Computable genetic findings as well as genotypes, haplotypes, variations and sequences."/>
  <p>
    <b>Figure 4 - Genetic Findings</b>
  </p>
  <p>
    Genetic findings can be broken into two categories: those where the results are expressed as discrete coded data elements (<a href="obs-comp-gen-finding.html">computable findings</a>) and those where the results are primarily expressed as human narrative (<a href="obs-desc-gen-finding.html">non-computable findings</a>).  Both types of findings can support the determination of genetic impacts, but only computable findings can be used with automated decision support.
  </p>
  <p>
    Computable findings can be subdivided into three types of observations:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li><a href="obs-genotype.html">Genotypes</a> describe combinations of genetic variations that together are associated with a particular phenotype - i.e. a specific physical, behavioral or risk-associated difference associated with the organism whose specimen was tested.</li>
    <li><a href="obs-haplotype.html">Haplotypes</a> describe a set of genetic variations that appear on a single strand of DNA - and which are therefore typically inherited together</li>
    <li><i>Variants</i> are specific differences or combinations of differences between parts of one or more specimen sequences and the equivalent portions of the reference sequence(s) for that organism.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    These categories of observations have relationships.  Haplotypes can be identified based on the presence of variants.  Genotypes can be identified based on the presence of haplotypes and/or variants.  All three can be expressed as a combination of one or more sequences.
  </p>

  <h2>Other content</h2>
  <p>
    The profiles describing the detailed observations within a genetic report are found in the other sections of this implementation guide based on what type of testing and reporting is being done:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>The <a href="sequencing.html">Sequenced Variants</a> section deals with all types of variants detected by formal sequencing, including simple/discrete variants, structural variants and complex variants detected by direct sequencing, shot-gun-based sequencing and array-based testing for specific variants.</li>
    <li>The <a href="cytogenomics.html">Cytogenomic Reporting</a> section deals with all types of cytogenetic observations including single-code cytogenetic notations (i.e. ISCN codes), FISH test results and microarray results.</li>
    <li>The <a href="pharmacogenomics.html">Pharmacogenomic Reporting</a> section deals with genetic testing related to medication results.  It primarily focuses on medication-related impacts of variation, haplotype and genotype observations.</li>
    <li>The <a href="somatics.html">Somatic Genomic Reporting</a> section deals with non-germline variations, particularly those related to tumors.</li>
    <li>The <a href="transplants.html">Genomic Profiling for Transplantation</a> section deals with information related to variations relevant to matching of donor candidates with recipients, including HLA typing.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    Many genetic reports will draw on more than one of these areas.  For example, a somatic report will typically include sequencing information as well as information on likely tumor susceptibility to particular medications.  Reports should draw on whatever sections are relevant.
